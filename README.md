## Title

README Generator

## Description

This project is aimed to support developers in generating professional READMEs quickly and effectively.

## Installation

This application utilizes the npm “inquirer” as its main installation. This allows us to ask questions and receive user inputs for our specific program.

## Usage

My hope is that this can be used by myself and other professionals who wish to optimize their days and save precious time with generating README’s. The application was meant to be robust to ensure that (hopefully) the application would meet the potential users needs. 

## Contribute

I do encourage anyone to go ahead and contribute to this code. I am certain there are other needs for other individuals that I have yet to think of at this time

## Test

Users will just have to clone my repo. The user will also need to download the NPM "inquirer" to take user input. Users may use a text editor that can work with JS and node.
